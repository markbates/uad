// Harrison® 32C Channel EQ
// The Harrison 32C Channel EQ plug-in for UAD-2 hardware and Apollo interfaces is an expert emulation of this classic, character-rich, four-band channel EQ. Partnering with Harrison Consoles Ltd. and engineer Bruce Swedien (Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson), Universal Audio has recreated the Harrison four-band 32C channel EQ from Swedien’s own Harrison 32 Series console — the same console behind Michael Jackson’s Thriller. “I never dreamed Universal Audio’s design team could come so unbelievably close to capturing the sound of my beloved desk,” says Swedien. “The additional Harrison EQs within Pro Tools sessions are a Godsend.” Renowned for its colorful, smooth high-end response, and friendly, put-it-on-everything usefulness, the Harrison 32C EQ plug-in features four overlapping parametric bands. Each of the Low (40-600 Hz), Low-Mid (200Hz to 3.1 kHz), Hi-Mid (400 Hz to 6 kHz), and High (900 Hz to 13 kHz) bands have fully sweepable Frequency and Gain Controls. Instead of traditional Q controls, the 32C has circuitry that automatically adjusts the effective bandwidth, adding to its signature sound. Furthermore, the Low band is switchable from Peak to Shelving EQ. Finally, the Harrison 32C features 12 dB per octave High and Low Pass filters which can be switched in or out.
