// The Bill Putnam Mic Collection
// The Bill Putnam Mic Collection plug-in, exclusively for UA Audio Interfaces and UAD hardware, adds nine vintage mic emulations — modeled from Bill Putnam Sr.’s renowned collection — to the Townsend Labs Sphere L22 microphone.
// These mic emulations not only nail the classic timbres of iconic mics used by Bill Putnam to track Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, and more, they also faithfully model the transient response, harmonics, proximity effect and three-dimensional polar response of the original mics.

Every model in the Ocean Way Microphone Collection plug-in is based on what he felt are the very best representations of classic mics from Neumann,® Sony,® RCA,® AKG,® and more.*
