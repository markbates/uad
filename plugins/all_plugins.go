// Neve® Summing
// A major ingredient behind thousands of influential, chart-topping records, Neve 80 series consoles are without equal. These classic analog desks — made famous in the Sound City documentary — deliver three-dimensional nonlinearities and analog heft that infuses your mixes with vibrancy and color.
// Developed in partnership with AMS Neve exclusively for LUNA Recording System, Neve Summing Extension emulates the entire summing circuit of an iconic Neve 80 series console — including its coveted 1272TM bus amplifiers — giving your LUNA mixes all the color of Neve's most cherished analog desk.
