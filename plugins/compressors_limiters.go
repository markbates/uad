// 1176 Classic Limiter Collection
// The original Universal Audio 1176 was designed by UA founder M.T. “Bill” Putnam, and represented a major breakthrough in limiter technology. The first true peak limiter to feature all-transistor circuitry and ultra-fast FET gain reduction, the 1176 has lent its character and punch to some of the greatest recordings in history.Universal Audio released its first 1176 plug-in emulation in 2001. This plug-in single-handedly launched the UAD platform, and inspired a decade of analog emulation software. Today, we’ve circled back to the 1176, and modeled its entire electronic path from stem to stern — including its transformers and FET and transistor amplifiers, resulting in unrivaled emulations of three distinct 1176 units.
